# Hackathon Score Board
In this project, I developed a scoreboard system using Flask for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage, implementing role-based access control to manage user permissions effectively.

### Architecture Overview:
Backend: Built with Flask, providing RESTful APIs to handle user authentication, score retrieval, and score updates.

Frontend: Developed with Angular, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface for score display and management.

Database: Utilized MongoDB to store user data and scores, ensuring efficient data retrieval and scalability.

### Key Features:
Role-Based Access Control: Implemented distinct user roles—viewers and administrators—to control access. Viewers can only view scores, while administrators have the authority to modify them.

User Authentication: Managed user sessions and ensured secure access to the system.

Responsive Design: Ensured the application is accessible and user-friendly across various devices and screen sizes.

This design ensures that the scoreboard system is both secure and user-friendly, with clear distinctions between user roles and their respective permissions.
